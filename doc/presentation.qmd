## Results: Gene Expression Analysis

## Results: Virtual pull-down and Gene Enrichement Analysis

-   After the pull-down we found:
    -   The nonpCR Group has 5 potential complexes or networks with upregulated or downregulated activity when comparing pre and post treatment
    -   The nonpCR Group has 11 potential complexes or networks with upregulated or downregulated activity when comparing pre- and post-treatment
-   For each network the main enriched biological processes were identified

## Discussion and Conclusion
