## Introduction

### Our Goals of the Study:

-   to compare gene expression and gene interaction networks for pre- and post- treatment

-   to conduct differential expression analysis across pCR and non-pCR groups

### The Goal of the Paper:

-   to investigate whether circulating exosomal microRNAs could predict pCR in breast cancer patients treated with NACT

- Statistical Testing for Differential Expression

- Multiple Testing Correction


## Methods: Virtual pull-down and Gene Enrichement Analysis {.scrollable}

-   Virtual pull-down:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(DiscoNet)
network_pCR <- virtual_pulldown(
  seed_nodes = seed, 
  database = string_database, 
  id_type = "hgnc", 
  string_confidence_score = 700) # default value


```

-   Community detection

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(DiscoNet)
communities_list <- community_detection(
  graph_object, 
  algorithm = "mcode", # specifies algorithm, in this case MCODE
  D = 0.05, # threshold of weight percentage of the vertex to be use by MCODE standard value
  haircut = TRUE) # removes the nodes that are only connected to a single node in the community detected

```

-   Over representation analysis

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(fgsea)

ora_result_nonpCR <- fora(
    pathways = biological_process_list, 
    genes = gense_in_each_community, 
    universe = all_genes_in_analysis, 
    minSize = 10
)

```

## Results: Virtual pull-down {.scrollable}

-   **Pre vs. Post Treatment**:
    -   The **nonpCR Group** has 5 potential complexes or networks with upregulated or downregulated activity when comparing pre- and post-treatment
    -   The **pCR Group** has 11 potential complexes or networks with upregulated or downregulated activity when comparing pre- and post-treatment
-   Example plots:

## Results: Gene Enrichement Analysis

-   For each relevant community in pCR and non_pCR the main enriched biological processes were identified
-   Representative plots:

## Discussion and Conclusion

- Differential gene expression was seen in higher levels in the pCR group
- Further analysis into the communities found by enrichment analysis
- Early diagnosis could help patients by:
  - If pCR is achieved: perhaps surgery is not needed
  - If pCR is not achieved: perhaps a different treatment method
