## Introduction: Paper and background

-   Circulating Exosomal microRNAs as Predictive Biomarkers of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response in Breast Cancer

|                                                |                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)`              | an increasingly used approach for treatment of breast cancer                                                          |
| `Circulating Exosomal microRNAs(miRNA)`        | small RNA molecules circulating in bodily fluids, potentially serving as biomarkers for treatment response after NACT |
| `Pathological Complete Response (pCR)`         | absence of active cancer cells in a tissue from the tumor site after NACT                                             |
| `Non-Pathological Complete Response (non-pCR)` | presence of active cancer cells in a tissue from the tumor site after the treatment                                   |

-   The purpose of the study: to investigate whether circulating exosomal microRNAs could predict pCR in breast cancer patients treated with NACT

## Results: Gene Expression Analysis

## Results: Virtual pull-down and Gene Enrichement Analysis

-   After the pull-down we found:
    -   The nonpCR Group has 5 potential complexes or networks with upregulated or downregulated activity when comparing pre and post treatment
    -   The nonpCR Group has 11 potential complexes or networks with upregulated or downregulated activity when comparing pre- and post-treatment
-   For each network the main enriched biological processes were identified
