| `Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)`              | an increasingly used approach for treatment of breast cancer                                                          |
| `Circulating Exosomal microRNAs(miRNA)`        | small RNA molecules circulating in bodily fluids, potentially serving as biomarkers for treatment response after NACT |
| `Pathological Complete Response (pCR)`         | absence of active cancer cells in a tissue from the tumor site after NACT                                             |
| `Non-Pathological Complete Response (non-pCR)` | presence of active cancer cells in a tissue from the tumor site after the treatment                                   |

-   The purpose of the study: to investigate whether circulating exosomal microRNAs could predict pCR in breast cancer patients treated with NACT

## Methods: Virtual pull-down and Gene Enrichement Analysis {.scrollable}

-   Virtual pull-down:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(DiscoNet)
network_pCR <- virtual_pulldown(
  seed_nodes = seed, 
  database = string_database, 
  id_type = "hgnc", 
  string_confidence_score = 700) # default value


```

-   Community detection

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(DiscoNet)
communities_list <- community_detection(
  graph_object, 
  algorithm = "mcode", # specifies algorithm, in this case MCODE
  D = 0.05, # threshold of weight percentage of the vertex to be use by MCODE standard value
  haircut = TRUE) # removes the nodes that are only connected to a single node in the community detected

```

-   Over representation analysis

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(fgsea)

ora_result_nonpCR <- fora(
    pathways = biological_process_list, 
    genes = gense_in_each_community, 
    universe = all_genes_in_analysis, 
    minSize = 10

## Results: Gene Expression Analysis

## Results: Virtual pull-down and Gene Enrichement Analysis

-   After the pull-down we found:
    -   The nonpCR Group has 5 potential complexes or networks with upregulated or downregulated activity when comparing pre and post treatment
    -   The nonpCR Group has 11 potential complexes or networks with upregulated or downregulated activity when comparing pre- and post-treatment
-   For each network the main enriched biological processes were identified
