| `Pathological Complete Response (pCR)`         | absence of active cancer cells in a tissue from the tumor site after NACT                                             |
| `Non-Pathological Complete Response (non-pCR)` | presence of active cancer cells in a tissue from the tumor site after the treatment                                   |

## Our Goals of Study:

-   The purpose of the study: to investigate whether circulating exosomal microRNAs could predict pCR in breast cancer patients treated with NACT

-   

-   

-   

## Experimental Methods:

-   20 breast cancer patients

-   plasma samples -\> NACT -\> plasma samples

-   6 patients - pCR

    14 patients - non pCR

## Results: Gene Expression Analysis

## Results: Virtual pull-down and Gene Enrichement Analysis

-   After the pull-down we found:
    -   The nonpCR Group has 5 potential complexes or networks with upregulated or downregulated activity when comparing pre and post treatment
    -   The nonpCR Group has 11 potential complexes or networks with upregulated or downregulated activity when comparing pre- and post-treatment
-   For each network the main enriched biological processes were identified
